# RecommendMe
##Description:
This application was created to organize and share recommendations.   A user is able to see a listing of current recommendations, create new recommendations, and edit, delete and comment on existing recommendations.  Recommendations can also be viewed by category, and the details of each recommendation can be viewed separately.

##Install Instructions:
To use this app, just fork and clone it from GitHub, run 'bundle install', and 'rake db:migrate'. Then launch it by entering "rake start" in your terminal.  This will initiate two separate connections, one which will start the React server, and another which will start the Rails API server.  In the development environment, API requests will automatically be proxied to the correct server, and CORS issues will be avoided.
